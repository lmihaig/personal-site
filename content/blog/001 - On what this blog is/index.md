**First off**, I have no idea how you found this site, I don't know what you'll expect but I hope my short post here will explain what I envision for this blog.

This will be a somewhat public part of my brain. I'll write small blog posts on things I find interesting, things I need to write down to remember or just things I put effort in and think someone somewhere might find valuable. There is not really any one general topic, I just want to write about the things I'm passionate about, be it tech/security oriented or closer to the humanities (probably music, history and cinema). Basically just yapping but hopefully somewhat high effort.

Also, you will absolutely **not** see any LLM generated text here.

I asked myself "why would I even want to have a blog?" and honestly the only answer that convinced me was that I truly appreciate the existing good blogs out there. Whenever I had specific technical problems or questions the best resources were always some blog post of a very passionate person writing on the subject. Now, I don't consider myself an expert in anything and I don't have the expertise to help people in the same sense but that is part of the person I wish to become, and if one day a thing I wrote helped out even one person that will be enough for me.

At the end of the day I won't mind if this is yet another irrelevant blog in the sea of spam that is the modern web, but it'd be cool if it wouldn't end up that way.
